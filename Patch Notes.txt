Changed the soundbank extension(.wdb) to .sb so people can actually understand it. (Srsly I thought it was a Microsoft Works file!)
Extended the frequency limit from 100-1900 to 0-65535(65535 is the max.)
Added a new file! (.org16 for use with the 16 tracks in OrgMaker 16, note: it'll be a normal ORG file if none of the new tracks are used.)
Made the drams appear in ResourceHacker again.
Made the error messages appear in normal textboxes again.

Disabled MIDI and WAV Export for the time being, I fear it may cause an error with the 16 tracks.

	Goals:

		-Create 8 more usable melody/dram tracks

		-Finish volume functions

		-Add a some Panning functions

		-Set back the track going over the frequency limit
